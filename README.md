# SIMPLE-CALCULATOR
A simple console-based calculator built using C that performs basic arithmetic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division between two numbers entered by the user.
It helps beginners understand key programming concepts such as **switch-case**, **conditional logic**, **user input**, and **arithmetic operators** in C.

Features:
- Performs **Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)** 
- Accepts **user input** for both numbers and operation  
- Uses a **switch-case** structure for operation selection  
- Displays results with formatted output  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to modify

Technologies Used:
- **Language:** C  
- **Compiler:** GCC  / Turbo C / Code::Blocks / Online C Compiler(GCD)
- **Concepts Covered:** Switch-case, Conditional Logic, I/O Operations, Arithmetic Operators

How It Works:
1. The program asks the user to enter two numbers.  
2. It then prompts the user to enter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).  
3. Based on the operator, it performs the corresponding operation using a **switch-case** statement.  
4. The result is displayed on the screen.

Sample Output:
ENTER NUM1=10
ENTER NUM2=5
ENTER THE OPERATION=*
PRODUCT=50.000000
